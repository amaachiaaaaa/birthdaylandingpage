                <h1>My Wish</h1>
                <p>Happy Birthday to an amazing friend! You light up every room you walk into and bring so much joy to
                    everyone around you. I am so grateful for your friendship, your kindness, and all the beautiful
                    memories we share. Here is to a year filled with love, laughter, and endless happinessâ€”just like you
                    deserve</p>
                <p>Today I pray for you, Dear Lord we lift up this beautiful soul on her special day. May You bless her
                    with joy, health, and abundant love in the year ahead. Surround her with favor in all she does,
                    guiding her steps with wisdom and filling her heart with peace. May every dream she holds close come
                    to life, and may she always feel Your love and presence in every moment. Amen. </p>
